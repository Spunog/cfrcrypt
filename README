NAME
    cfrcrypt - A tool to encrypt or decrypt ColdFusion Report files.

SYNOPSIS
      cfrcrypt [-e|-d] <-o output> <input>

DESCRIPTION
    ColdFusion sports a custom report file format (.cfr) which is,
    unfortunately, encoded, such that these files become opaque blobs which
    cannot be version controlled, modified via scripts, etc. This tool makes
    it possible to decode these files, modify them, and then re-encode them
    for use with ColdFusion.

    By default, the tool reads from standard input and writes to standard
    output. However, if an input file is specified, the data is read from
    that location, and if an output file is specified, the results are
    written there (note, the file indicated is overwritten).

OPTIONS
    Note, either -e or -d must be specified. All other arguments are
    optional.

    -e      Encrypt the input data provided.

    -d      Decrypt the input data provided.

    -o      Write the output to the specified file.

FILE FORMAT
    ColdFusion report file is structured with a header of 39 bytes, followed
    by an XTEA-encrypted payload. XTEA (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA)
    is a simple symmetric cipher employing 64-bit blocks and a 128-bit key.
    The actual file structure is as follows:

      | Header (27) | Unused (4) |
      | K4 (4)      | K0 (4)     |
      |           Data           |

    Where K0 and K4 represent the first and last 32-bit words of the key.
    The middle 64 bits are a hard-coded shared key.
