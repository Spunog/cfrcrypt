       cfrcrypt - A tool to encrypt or decrypt ColdFusion Report files.

       ColdFusion sports a custom report file format (.cfr) which is,
       unfortunately, encoded, such that these files become opaque blobs which
       cannot be version controlled, modified via scripts, etc.  This tool
       makes it possible to decode these files, modify them, and then re-
       encode them for use with ColdFusion.

       By default, the tool reads from standard input and writes to standard
       output.  However, if an input file is specified, the data is read from
       that location, and if an output file is specified, the results are
       written there (note, the file indicated is overwritten).

       Note, either --ee or --dd mmuusstt be specified.  All other arguments are
       optional.

       --ee      Encrypt the input data provided.

       --dd      Decrypt the input data provided.

       --oo      Write the output to the specified file.

       ColdFusion report file is structured with a header of 39 bytes,
       followed by an XTEA-encrypted payload.  XTEA
       (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTEA) is a simple symmetric cipher
       employing 64-bit blocks and a 128-bit key.  The actual file structure
       is as follows:

         | Header (27) | Unused (4) |
         | K4 (4)      | K0 (4)     |
         |           Data           |

       Where K0 and K4 represent the first and last 32-bit words of the key.
       The middle 64 bits are a hard-coded shared key.
